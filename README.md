# Data Analyst/Science Portfolio 

Hi i'm Jessica,
I am enthusiastic about data and how it can be used to glean insights that have the potential to solve some of the world's problems, and provide valuable information that will help others. I hold a MSc in Big Data Science and a BSc in Mathematics (so yes! I'm a huge numbers person), details on my completed modules are below. This portfolio showcases projects completed in my own time. Enjoy :D !

## Projects

[Covid Deaths, Vaccinations and Manufacturers](https://github.com/Data-JA/Covid-19-Deaths-Vaccinations-and-Manufacturers)

Investigated and analysed COVID-19 deaths, cases, and vaccine manufacturer data, and derive meaningful insights and trends, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the pandemic's impact and vaccination efforts.
* Exploratory Data Analysis: SQL, Microsoft SQL Server 
* Data Visualisation: [Tableau](link)

         
[London Airbnb, Restaurants and Crime](https://github.com/Data-JA/London-Airbnb-Restaurants-and-Crime)
* Exploratory Data Analysis: SQL
* Data Visualisation: [Tableau](link)

        
[Educational Data](https://github.com/Data-JA/Education-Data) 
* Data Wrangling and Exploratory Data Analysis: Excel
* Data Visualisation: Excel

     
[Credit Card Approval Prediction](https://github.com/Data-JA/credit-card-approval-prediction)

Described how machine learning aids in the process of approving credit card applications for a traditional bank. This technique is used to improve and automate the system. The power of machine learning erdicates the manual analysing of these applications, which are often human error-prone and time consuming.
* Data Wrangling, Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning: Python
